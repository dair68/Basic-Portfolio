        I am an aspiring programmer currently studying applied math at UCLA. 
        Topics I enjoy include computation, differential equations, and mathematical modeling. 
        I love solving puzzles and taking on new challenges. I've made programs in C++, Java, and Python,
        and aim to add more programming languages to the list!

        In my free time I like to play videogames and the piano. My favorite videogames include <em>Super Metroid</em>
        , <em>Shin Megami Tensei IV</em>, and <em>Nine Persons, Nine Hours, Nine Doors</em>. My absolute favorite songs
        to play on the piano are "Lost in Thoughts All Alone" and "Bluebird Lamentation", which are from 
        <em>Fire Emblem Fates</em> and <em>Virtue's Last Reward</em> respectively. One day I'd like to combine all of 
        my interests and create a simple game of my own, with original musical compositions and fun puzzles.
