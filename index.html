    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <article>
        <p> I am a current UCLA student studying applied math. I'm interested in computation,
            differential equations, and mathematical modeling. I love solving puzzles and 
            taking on new challenges.
        </p>
        <p> In my free time I play videogames and the piano. My favorite videogames include Super
            Metroid, Shin Megami Tensei IV, and Nine Persons, Nine Hours, Nine Doors. One day I'd 
            like to combine all of my interests and create a simple game of my own, with original 
            musical compositions and fun puzzles.
